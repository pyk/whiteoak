This is the Postfix 2.12 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.11.x where 2=major
release number, 11=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.12-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.10 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.11
before proceeding.

Notes for distribution maintainers
----------------------------------

* New backwards-compatibility safety net.

With NEW Postfix installs, you MUST install a main.cf file with
the setting "compatibility_level = 2". See conf/main.cf for an
example.

With UPGRADES of existing Postfix systems, you MUST NOT change the
main.cf compatibility_level setting (if any).

Several Postfix default settings have changed with Postfix 2.12.
To avoid massive breakage, Postfix comes with a safety net that
forces Postfix to keep running with backwards-compatible main.cf
and master.cf default settings. This safety net depends on the
main.cf compatibility_level setting (if any). Details are in
COMPATIBILITY_README.

* New Postfix build system.

The Postfix build/install procedure has changed to support Postfix
shared libraries and database plugins.

[Update 20140625: As a result of maintainer feedback, 1) the Postfix
release version is no longer used as a filename suffix for Postfix
shared libraries, database plugins or dynamicmaps.cf; 2) non-executable
files have been moved away from $daemon_directory to $meta_directory
(usually, /etc/postfix).  The release notes below for 20140530 have
been updated accordingly.]

To avoid massive frustration due to broken patches, PLEASE BUILD
POSTFIX FIRST WITHOUT APPLYING ANY PATCHES.  Follow the INSTALL
instructions (see "Building with Postfix shared libraries and
database plugins" below), and see how things work and what the
shared libraries, database plugin, and configuration files look
like.  Only then, go ahead and perform your platform-specific
customizations.

Maintainers may also benefit from the makedefs documentation
(mantools/srctoman - makedefs | nroff -man | less) with information
about build options that are not described in the INSTALL instructions.

Major changes with snapshot 20141224
====================================

Compile-time argument typechecks of non-printf/scanf-like variadic
function argument lists. This change produces no directly-visible
result, but it makes Postfix code easier to maintain, and therefore
makes new functionality easier to add.

Major changes with snapshot 20141207
====================================

First stage in the cleanup of old crufty C that dates from the days
of SunOS4, years before void * and size_t became unversally available.
These cleanups will destroy lots of patches, but after 17 years the
time has come.

The first-stage cleanup deprecates the use of "char *" for non-text
purposes such as memory allocation and pointers to application
context for call-back functions.  

A second-stage cleanup will replace many integer types for counters
and sizes with size_t or ssize_t equivalents.  This will eliminate
wasteful 64-32bit conversions on 64-bit systems.

Major changes with snapshot 20141128
====================================

Support for DNS server reply filters in the Postfix SMTP client
and server. This renders the result in standard zone file format:

    name ttl class type preference value

The class field is always "IN", the preference field exists only
for MX records, the names of hosts, domains, etc. end in ".", and
those names are in ASCII form (xn--mumble form in the case of UTF8
names).

When a match is found, the table lookup result specifies an action.
By default, the table query and the action name are case-insensitive.
Currently, only the IGNORE action is implemented.

For safety reasons, Postfix logs a warning or defers mail delivery
when a filter removes all lookup results from a successful query.

The smtp_dns_reply_filter and lmtp_dns_reply_filter features are
used only for Postfix SMTP client lookups of MX, A, and AAAAA records
to locate a remote SMTP or LMTP server, including lookups that are
made to implement the features reject_unverified_sender and
reject_unverified_recipient.

The smtpd_dns_reply_filter feature is used only for Postfix SMTP
server lookups of MX, A, AAAAA, and TXT records to implement the
features reject_unknown_helo_hostname, reject_unknown_sender_domain,
reject_unknown_recipient_domain, reject_rbl_*, and reject_rhsbl_*.

Implicit DNS lookups through nsswitch.conf or equivalent mechanisms
are not filtered.

Major changes with snapshot 20141126
====================================

Nullmx support (MX records with a null hostname). This change affects
error messages only.  The Postfix SMTP client already bounced mail
for such domains, and the Postfix SMTP server already rejected such
domains with reject_unknown_sender/recipient_domain. This introduces
a new SMTP server configuration parameter nullmx_reject_code (default:
556).

Major changes with snapshot 20141119
====================================

Support for BCC actions in header/body_checks and milter_header_checks.
There is no limit on the number of BCC actions that may be specified,
other than the implicit limit due to finite storage. BCC support
will not be implemented in Postfix delivery agents.

It works in the same way as always_bcc and sender/recipient_bcc_maps:
there can be only one address per action, recipients are added with
the NOTIFY=NONE delivery status notification option, and duplicate
recipients are ignored (with the same delivery status notification
options).

Major changes with snapshot 20141011
====================================

Support to fall back to an unauthenticated TLS security level ("may"
or "encrypt) when the Postfix SMTP client cannot establish the
preferred authenticated TLS security level ("dane", "dane-only",
"fingerprint", "verify", or "secure"). The fall-back levels may be
specified globally with the smtp_tls_fallback_level parameter or
in per-site TLS policies with the "fallback" attribute.

Fallback to unauthenticated TLS is logged, so that downgrade attacks
are "tamper-evident".  Fallback should be used only when testing,
or temporarily when working around a known problem at a remote site.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20141009
===========================================

The default settings have changed for relay_domains (new: empty,
old: $mydestination) and mynetworks_style (new: host, old: subnet).
However the backwards-compatibility safety net will prevent these
changes from taking effect, giving the system administrator the
option to make an old default setting permanent in main.cf or to
adopt the new default setting, before turning off backwards
compatibility. See COMPATIBILITY_README for details.

With this the built-in compatibility level changes from 1 to 2.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20141001
===========================================

The default settings have changed for append_dot_mydomain (new: no.
old: yes), master.cf chroot (new: n, old: y), and smtputf8 (new:
yes, old: no).

A new backwards-compatibility safety net forces Postfix to run with
backwards-compatible main.cf and master.cf default settings after
an upgrade to a newer but incompatible Postfix version. See
COMPATIBILITY_README for details.

While the backwards-compatible default settings are in effect,
Postfix logs what services or what email would be affected by the
incompatible change. Based on this the administrator can make some
backwards-compatibility settings permanent in main.cf or master.cf,
before turning off backwards compatibility.

See postconf.5.html#compatibility_level for details.

With this the built-in compatibility level changes from 0 to 1.

Major changes with snapshot 20140928
====================================

Per-Milter settings
-------------------
Support for per-Milter settings that override main.cf parameters.
For details see the section "Advanced policy client configuration"
in the SMTPD_POLICY_README document.

Here is an example that uses both old and new syntax:

    smtpd_milters = { inet:127.0.0.1:port1, default_action=accept, ... },
        inet:127.0.0.1:port2, ...

The per-milter settings are specified as attribute=value pairs
separated by comma or space; specify { name = value } to allow
spaces around the "=" or within an attribute value.

The supported attribute names are: command_timeout, connect_timeout,
content_timeout, default_action, and protocol. These have the same
names as the corresponding main.cf parameters, without the "milter_"
prefix.

Per-policy service settings
---------------------------
Support for per-policy service settings that override main.cf
parameters.  For details see the section "Different settings for
different Milter applications" in the MILTER_README document.

Here is an example that uses both old and new syntax:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions = ...
    check_policy_service { inet:127.0.0.1:port3, default_action=DUNNO }
    check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:port4
    ...

The per-policy service settings are specified as attribute=value pairs
separated by comma or space; specify { name = value } to allow
spaces around the "=" or within an attribute value.

The supported attribute names are: default_action, max_idle, max_ttl,
request_limit, retry_delay, timeout, try_limit. These have the same
names as the corresponding main.cf parameters, without the
"smtpd_policy_service_" prefix.

Whitespace in master.cf command-line arguments
----------------------------------------------
Support for whitespace in daemon command-line arguments. For details, see
the "Command name + arguments" section in the master(5) manpage.
Example:

    smtpd -o { parameter = value containing whitespace } ...

The { ... } form is also available for non-option command-line
arguments in master.cf, for example:

    pipe ... argv=command { argument containing whitespace } ...

In both cases, whitespace immediately after "{" and before "}"
is ignored.

Major changes with snapshot 20140921
====================================

In preparation for configurable mail headers and logging, new main.cf
support for if-then-else expressions:

    ${name?{text1}:{text2}}

and for logical expressions: 

    ${{text1}=={text2}?{text3}:{text4}}
    ${{text1}!={text2}?{text3}:{text4}}

Whitespace before and after {text} is ignored. This can help to
make complex expressions more readable.  See the postconf(5) manpage
for further details.

The syntax of pipemap and randmap has improved. Postfix now uses
pipemap:{map1, ..., mapN} and randmap:{result1, ..., resultN}.
The old syntax was just too ugly.

It is expected that usability can be improved elsewhere in Postfix
in a similar manner.  For example, 

- Milter clients and policy clients with non-default settings:
  smtpd_milters = {inet:host:port, timeout=xxx, default_action=yyy}, ...

- Parameter overrides in master.cf with commas and spaces:
  -o { parameter = value ... }

Major changes with snapshot 20140801
====================================

The Postfix SMTP server now logs at the end of a session how many
times an SMTP command was successfully invoked, followed by the
total number of invocations if it is different.

This logging will often be enough to diagnose a problem without
verbose logging or network sniffer.

    Normal session, no TLS:
        disconnect from name[addr] ehlo=1 mail=1 rcpt=1 data=1 quit=1

    Normal session. with TLS:
        disconnect from name[addr] ehlo=2 starttls=1 mail=1 rcpt=1 data=1 quit=1

    All recipients rejected, no ESMTP command pipelining:
        disconnect from name[addr] ehlo=1 mail=1 rcpt=0/1 quit=1

    All recipients rejected, with ESMTP command pipelining:
        disconnect from name[addr] ehlo=1 mail=1 rcpt=0/1 data=0/1 rset=1 quit=1

    Password guessing bot, hangs up without QUIT:
        disconnect from name[addr] ehlo=1 auth=0/1

    Mis-configured client trying to use TLS wrappermode on port 587:
        disconnect from name[addr] unknown=0/1

Logfile analyzers can trigger on the presence of "/". It indicates
that Postfix rejected at least one command.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20140714
===========================================

After upgrading Postfix, the "postfix reload" (or start/stop) is
required. Several Postfix-internal protocols have been extended to
support SMTPUTF8. Failure to reload or restart will result in mail
staying queued and the logile will contain warning messages about
unexpected attributes.

Major changes with snapshot 20140715
====================================

Support for Email Address Internationalization (EAI) as defined in
RFC 6531..6533. This supports UTF-8 in SMTP/LMTP sender addresses,
recipient addresses, and message header values.  The implementation
is based on initial work by Arnt Gulbrandsen that was funded by
CNNIC.

See SMTPUTF8_README for a description of Postfix SMTPUTF8 support.

Major changes with snapshot 20140703
====================================

This release introduces three new configuration parameters that
control error recovery for failed SMTPD policy requests.

  * smtpd_policy_service_default_action (default: 451 4.3.5 Server
    configuration problem): The default action when an SMTPD policy
    service request fails.

  * smtpd_policy_service_try_limit (default: 2): The maximal number
    of attempts to send an SMTPD policy service request before
    giving up. This must be a number greater than zero.

  * smtpd_policy_service_retry_delay (default: 1s): The delay between
    attempts to resend a failed SMTPD policy service request. This
    must be a number greater than zero.

See postconf(5) for details and limitations.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20140701
===========================================

For clarity, the pipeline and random lookup tables are now called
pipemap and randmap, respectively. The 20140618 text below has been
updated accordingly. The old names remain supported for a while.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20140625
===========================================

For compliance with file system policies, some files have been moved
from $daemon_directory to the directory specified with the new
meta_directory configuration parameter which has the same default
value as the config_directory parameter. This change affects
non-executable files that are shared between multiple Postfix
instances such as postfix-files, dynamicmaps.cf, and multi-instance
template files.

For backwards compatibility with Postfix 2.6 .. 2.11, specify
"meta_directory = $daemon_directory" in main.cf before installing
or upgrading Postfix, or specify "meta_directory = /path/name" on
the "make makefiles", "make install" or "make upgrade" command line.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20140618
===========================================

The pipe(8) delivery agent will now log a limited amount of command
output upon successful delivery, and will report that output in
"SUCCESS" delivery status reports. This is another good reason to
disable inbound DSN requests at the Internet perimeter.

Major changes with snapshot 20140618
====================================

This introduces several lookup tables with unusual properties.

randmap table
------------

The "randmap" lookup table performs random selection. This may be
used to implement load balancing, for example:

/etc/postfix/transport:
    # Deliver my own domain as usual.
    example.com :
    .example.com :

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    transport_maps = 
        # Deliver my own domain as usual.
        hash:/etc/postfix/transport 
        # Deliver other domains via randomly-selected relayhosts
        randmap:!smtp:smtp0.example.com!smtp:smtp1.example.com

A variant of this can randomly select SMTP clients with different
smtp_bind_address settings.

The first ASCII character after "randmap:" will be used as the
separator between the results that follow (do not use space, ",",
":" or non-ASCII).

Some future version may support the form randmap:/path/to/file,
to load the list of random values, one per line, from a textfile.

To implement different weights, specify lookup results multiple
times. For example, to choose smtp:smtp1.example.com twice as often
as smtp:smtp0.example.com, specify smtp:smtp1.example.com twice.

pipemap table
--------------

As the name suggests, the "pipemap" table implements a pipeline
of lookup tables. The name of the table specifies the pipeline as
a sequence of tables. For example, the following prevents SMTP mail
to system accounts that have "nologin" as their login shell:

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        local_recipient_maps = 
            pipemap:!unix:passwd.byname!pcre:/etc/postfix/no-nologin.pcre
            alias_maps

    /etc/postfix/no-nologin.pcre:
        !/nologin/      whatever

The first ASCII character after "pipemap:" will be used as the
separator between the lookup tables that follow (do not use space,
",", ":" or non-ASCII).

Each "pipemap:" query is given to the first table. Each table
lookup result becomes the query for the next table in the pipeline,
and the last table produces the final result.  When any table lookup
produces no result, the entire pipeline produces no result.

Some future version may support the form pipemap:/path/to/file,
to load the list of lookup tables, one per line, from a textfile.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20140530
===========================================

The Postfix 2.12 build procedure expects that you specify database
library dependencies with variables named AUXLIBS_CDB, AUXLIBS_LDAP,
etc.  With Postfix 2.12 and later, the old AUXLIBS variable still
supports building a statically-loaded CDB etc. database client, but
only the new AUXLIBS_CDB etc. variables support building a
dynamically-loaded or statically-loaded CDB etc. database client.
See CDB_README, LDAP_README, etc. for details.

Failure to follow this advice will defeat the purpose of dynamic
database client loading. Every Postfix executable file will have
database library dependencies. And that was exactly what dynamic
database client loading was meant to avoid.

Major changes with snapshot 20140530
====================================

Support to build Postfix with Postfix shared libraries, and with
dynamically-loadable database clients. Postfix shared libraries
introduce minor runtime overhead and result in smaller Postfix
executable files. Dynamically-loadable database clients are useful
when you distribute or install pre-compiled packages.  Postfix 2.12
supports dynamic loading for CDB, LDAP, LMDB, MYSQL, PCRE, PGSQL,
SDBM, and SQLITE database clients.

This is based on Debian code by LaMont Jones, and based on a port
by Viktor Dukhovni. Currently, support exists for recent versions
of Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, and for the ancient Solaris 9.

To support Postfix shared libraries and dynamically-loadable database
clients, the Postfix build procedure had to be changed (specifically,
the files makedefs and Makefile.in, and the files postfix-install
and post-install that install or update Postfix).  These changes
are introduced early in the annual Postfix development cycle to
give down-stream maintainers sufficient time to prepare their build
systems for the next stable Postfix release in 2015.

Building with Postfix shared libraries and database plugins
-----------------------------------------------------------

Please see the INSTALL section "Building with Postfix shared libraries
and database plugins" for fine-tuning details. 

To build with Postfix shared libraries (files named libpostfix-*.so),
use:

% make makefiles shared=yes ...other arguments...

To build with dynamicmaps.cf support and dynamically-loadable
database clients (files named postfix-*.so), use:

% make makefiles dynamicmaps=yes ...other arguments...

This implicitly enables support for Postfix shared libraries. Postfix
2.12 supports dynamic loading for CDB, LDAP, LMDB, MYSQL, PCRE,
PGSQL, SDBM, and SQLITE database clients.

NOTE: The Postfix 2.12 build procedure expects that you specify
database library dependencies with variables named AUXLIBS_CDB,
AUXLIBS_LDAP, etc.  With Postfix 2.12 and later, the old AUXLIBS
variable still supports building a statically-loaded database client,
but only the new AUXLIBS_CDB etc. variables support building a
dynamically-loaded or statically-loaded CDB etc. database client.
See CDB_README, LDAP_README, etc. for details.

Failure to follow this advice will defeat the purpose of dynamic
database client loading. Every Postfix executable file will have
database library dependencies. And that was exactly what dynamic
database client loading was meant to avoid.

Differences with Debian
-----------------------

Besides changes to the Postfix "build" system as described above,
the user-visible changes with respect to Debian are:

- The new shlib_directory parameter specifies the location of the
  libpostfix-*.so shared-library files and the postfix-*.so database
  plugins. You can change the location of these files after Postfix
  is built. However, you may have to run ldconfig if you change the
  libpostfix-*.so location.  No ldconfig is needed if you keep the
  libpostfix-*.so files in the compiled-in default $shlib_directory
  location.

- The new meta_directory parameter specifies the location of the
  file dynamicmaps.cf and some other non-executable files. The
  meta_directory parameter has the same default value as the
  config_directory parameter, so this is backwards compatible with
  Debian (but the default setting may be changed at compile time).

- Postfix supports the directory dynamicmaps.cf.d in addition to
  the file dynamicmaps.cf. Maintainers can use one configuration
  file per database plugin, which simplifies installation and
  removal of individual plugins.

- Likewise, Postfix supports the directory postfix-files.d in
  addition to the file postfix-files, Again, maintainers can use
  one configuration file per database plugin, which simplifies
  installation and removal of individual plugins.

Major changes with snapshot 20140321
====================================

Delivery status filter support, to replace the delivery status codes
and explanatory text of successful or unsuccessful deliveries by
Postfix mail delivery agents.

This was originally implemented for sites that want to turn certain
soft delivery errors into hard delivery errors, but it can also be
used to censor out information from delivery confirmation reports.

This feature is implemented as a filter that replaces the three-number
enhanced status code and descriptive text in Postfix delivery agent
success, bounce, or defer messages. Note: this will not override
"soft_bounce=yes", and this will not change a successful delivery
status into an unsuccessful status or vice versa.

The first example turns specific soft TLS errors into hard
errors, by overriding the first number in the enhanced status code.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtp_delivery_status_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/smtp_dsn_filter

/etc/postfix/smtp_dsn_filter:
    /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but host \S+ refused to start TLS: .+)/ 5$1
    /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but was not offered by host .+)/ 5$1

The second example removes the destination command name and file
name from local(8) successful delivery reports, so that they will
not be reported when a sender requests confirmation of delivery.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    local_delivery_status_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/local_dsn_filter

/etc/postfix/local_dsn_filter:
    /^(2\S+ delivered to file).+/    $1
    /^(2\S+ delivered to command).+/ $1

This feature is supported in the lmtp(8), local(8), pipe(8), smtp(8)
and virtual(8) delivery agents. That is, all delivery agents that
actually deliver mail. 

The new main.cf parameters and default values are:

    default_delivery_status_filter =
    lmtp_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter
    local_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter
    pipe_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter
    smtp_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter
    virtual_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter

See the postconf(5) manpage for more details.
